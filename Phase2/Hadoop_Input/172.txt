Speaking on the history of multiculturalism in Southeast Asia, Ali traced the rise of influence of Islam within this dynamic. His remarks also were condensed into an opinion piece that ran in the <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/">Jakarta Post</a>.

       <li> <p>Author, Professor of <a href="http://creativewriting.ucr.edu/">Creative Writing</a> and poet <a href="http://creativewriting.ucr.edu/people/jayme/">Michael Jaime Becerra</a>, returned home recently to talk to students about his writing, education and to read some of his work. While the assemblies were a treat for the students, it was also a treat for Becerra to return to Kranz where he attended and once lived near. Though no longer down the street from the school anymore, he still lives in El Monte. Most of Becerra's literary work is set in <a href="http://www.ci.el-monte.ca.us/">El Monte</a> and Kranz is even mentioned many times. His novels include &quot;Every Night Is Ladies Night&quot; and &quot;This Time Tomorrow.&quot; His book of poetry, &quot;The Estrellitas Off Peck Road&quot; is a source used in eighth grade at Kranz to teach poetry. <a href="http://www.sgvtribune.com/highlanders/ci_19208775">Read more</a>…</p> </li>

      <ul> 
       <li> <p><span style="color: black;">Akua Asa-Awuku, an Assistant Professor of <a href="http://www.cee.ucr.edu/">Chemical and Environmental Engineering</a>, and her team of graduate students are about to probe a new frontier in the understanding of global warming through a $450,000 grant from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">U.S. Environmental Project Agency</a>. The grant will pay for a three-year study of how soot and other fine particles from tailpipes and smokestacks affect climate change. Asa-Awuka hopes to learn precisely how climate change could be affected by reducing particle pollution, which already has been blamed for health problems including aggravating respiratory conditions, such as asthma, and causing early death. <a href="http://www.pe.com/local-news/topics/topics-environment-headlines/20111012-uc-riverside-scientist-wins-air-pollution-research-grant.ece">Read more.</a></span></p> </li>

She plans to develop biodegradable implant materials that would promote tissue regeneration and disappear after serving their functions in the body. One use could be in coronary stents. Currently, surgeons insert medical implants made of titanium alloys or stainless steel. Such implants sometimes create problems because the materials they’re made from can cause complications and fail. <a href="http://www.pe.com/local-news/topics/topics-health-care-headlines/20111004-region-ucr-researcher-awarded-grant.ece">Read more.</a></p> </li>

     <h3>Policy</h3> 
     <p> The University of California, Riverside is committed to ensuring the privacy and accuracy of your confidential information to the extent possible, subject to provisions of state and federal law. Other than as required by laws that guarantee public access to certain types of information, or in response to subpoenas or other legal instruments that authorize access, personally-identifiable information is not actively shared. In particular, we do not re-distribute or sell personal information collected on our web servers. </p> 
     <h3>Information Collected</h3> 
     <p> UCR websites may collect personal information such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number(s), and/or educational interests.

UCR may collect statistics identifying particular IP addresses from which our websites are accessed. </p> 
     <h3>Use of Collected Information</h3> 
     <p> UCR may use personal information collected from websites for the purpose of future communication back to online enrollees, in order to keep you informed of such activities as campus programs, symposia and/or special events, but only if you are provided the opportunity to opt out of that type of use. </p> 
     <p> UCR may use browser-IP-address information and anonymous-browser history to report information about site accesses and for statistical purposes. This information is generally used to improve Web presentation and utilization. The campus also may use IP address information for troubleshooting purposes. </p> 
     <p> Some UCR online activity sites may use &quot;cookies&quot; in order to deliver web content specific to individual users' interests or to keep track of online purchasing transactions. Sensitive personal information is not stored within cookies. </p> 
     <h3>Distribution of Collected Information</h3> 
     <p> UCR will not disclose, without your consent, personal information collected about you, except for certain explicit circumstances in which disclosure is required by law. </p> 
     <p> UCR will not distribute or sell personal information to third-party organizations. </p> 
     <h3>Individual Choice</h3> 
     <p> Individuals who wish to use methods other than online enrollment may submit requests by e-mail or U.S. mail addressed to the UC Riverside organization responsible for the website. </p> 
     <h3>Access to Your Own Information</h3> 
     <p> Questions regarding users' rights to review, modify or delete their previously provided personal information should be directed to the campus organization to which they provided the information. Any disputes will be resolved under existing records regulations applicable to UCR. </p> 
     <h3>Main Campus Site</h3>
