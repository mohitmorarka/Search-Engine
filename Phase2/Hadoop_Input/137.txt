They are, contrary to popular misconception, harmless and not venomous, though they are large enough and strong enough to inflict a painful bite, or jab with their leg spines, if handled carelessly. So far as is known, they feed on vegetable material, and are primarily nocturnal, hiding during the day. Most species seem to thrive only in areas of sandy soil, and a number of species are extremely rare, limited to a single small dune system, and thereby potentially on the brink of extinction; accordingly, it is suggested that you do not kill them if you encounter them.</font>

They are especially common in desert regions of the world, including Southern California, where various species in genera such as <i>Eremobates</i> and <i>Ammotrecha</i> regularly surprise and bewilder people encountering them for the first time. With their huge jaws (chelicerae), they are fearsome in appearance [see images below], but have no venom, and if they bite humans (requiring provocation) nothing will happen (despite some rather wild urban legends told by Desert Storm veterans). They are voracious predators of small arthropods, however, using the force of their jaws to kill their prey rather than venom. Some stories of them clipping hairs off the faces of sleeping humans do seem to have credible sources, but the only speculation as to why they might do this is if females use the hairs as lining for the burrow where they lay their eggs (a big IF). Since they are harmless to humans and many of the arthropods they consume are pests, Solpugids can be considered beneficial, and should be left unmolested.</font>

This sort of mass insect visitation often leads to panic and fear. Unfortunately, most homeowners are not reassured when told these bugs are harmless, and still go ahead and spray, which probably does more harm than good. If this is a recurring problem, then the simplest solution - and the only long-term solution - is to remove the boxelder tree (or trees) on which the bugs are feeding. The problem is that often there are many trees, not all of which are on the afflicted homeowner's property, and that these bugs will also sometimes feed on other maple species (yes, &quot;boxelder&quot; is a maple); in other words, removing the trees works only if ALL the possible host trees around are removed, and that's often impossible to coordinate when several pieces of property are involved.<br /> Links:<br /> <a href="http://www.uark.edu/ua/arthmuse/boxbug.html" target="_blank">Boisea trivittata color photo, information</a></font><p>&nbsp;</p></td>

Most homeowners at least can recognize ALBs as ladybugs, even though their coloration is variable [see image below, courtesy of Rob Curtis/The Early Birder] and they know not to be afraid of them (ironic, since these, like many ladybugs, WILL occasionally bite people), but the concern about hundreds of insects in one's home is still real. This insect was introduced to the US intentionally by the USDA (ostensibly to help increase the level of biological aphid control, especially of the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid - native ladybugs have their own natural enemies, you see, but the ALB, being exotic, has no natural enemies here), but apparently became established accidentally in the early '90s, though this is still unclear. It worked better than anyone had expected, and the ALB populations now reach epidemic proportions. The feds apparently had no idea that the ALB was also fond of warm places to spend the winter in hibernation, so imagine everyone's surprise when millions of complaints started pouring in from people who found these beetles invading their homes in the fall, starting in about 1993.<br /> To make the long story short, we're all going to have to get used to this, because there's no stopping them now. The ALB is here to stay, for our lifetimes, at least. Ecologically speaking, there is no reason not to kill them if they are in your home, since even if you could kill 50,000 of them, it wouldn't make a dent in their numbers; there are literally BILLIONS of them that will pass the winter across the US any given year. Moreover, they're an exotic species, and they're apparently driving our native ladybugs to extinction. Yes, really. If you want to toss them outside for the winter, then go right ahead - but there are no repellents to keep them away, so until the weather turns too cold for them to keep flying, you'll probably have more sneaking into your house. Note that ALBs, like all ladybugs, secrete a yellow, odorous defensive fluid, so if you squish them, you'll get yellow stains on whatever you squish them with. Some people have taken to just vacuuming them up and tossing them.</font>

In the northeastern US, and most of the country, the only species is <i>Xylocopa virginica</i> (not &quot;virginiana&quot;), while in California, the three common species are <i>X. varipuncta, X. tabaniformis,</i> and <i>X. californica.</i> The first species looks like a bumblebee, with yellow thorax and black abdomen (but the abdomen is SHINY, unlike all bumblebees), and males have yellow faces; the second has all-black females with bluish wings (that have greenish-gold reflections), but the males are golden-brown; the third has smaller black females, and the males are grayish with light faces; the last resembles the first somewhat, though the females have darker hair on the thorax and the abdomen has definite blue or blue-green metallic tints to it. Generally speaking, the damage they do is only cosmetic, and it is very rare for them to do enough damage to wood to cause structural problems. It is also uncommon for them to dig their tunnels into any wood that has a thick layer of paint or varnish on it, so this can be used as a fairly effective preventative measure.</font>

If you've got one of these wasps around, odds are good you'll see the other one nearby. There are over 450 other species in North America, nearly all of them laying their eggs in the nests of ground-nesting bees and wasps, especially in the Southwestern deserts.

Some people consider it the MOST painful venom (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmidt_Sting_Pain_Index" target="_blank">see here</a>), but this is always subjective.

Normally, use of this sting is reserved for their prey, which the venom paralyzes, but if mishandled by a person, they will use it in self-defense. They can be found essentially anywhere tarantulas and trap-door spiders occur, with the greatest abundance in the desert Southwest. Most SW species are black with metallic bluish highlights and orange wings, but species with black wings occur. There are two genera, <i>Pepsis</i> and <i>Hemipepsis,</i> which are very difficult to separate (subtle features of wing venation), but almost identical in biology. These wasps commonly visit flowers, especially milkweeds, for nectar, as this is essentially all the adult wasps feed on. The males are generally more often encountered than females, and can be recognized by their longer, straighter antennae, while females have short and rather strongly curled antennae.</font>

Females may have multiple underground chambers, one larva in each, in a single nest. Male cicada killers are strongly territorial, and will patrol almost incessantly in a small area near a nest aggregation, flying at anything passing by. They will even fly at humans, but are harmless unless they are grabbed. Male cicada killers are one of the very few cases where a male wasp can inflict a painful sting, using a sharp, venomless spine (called a pseudosting) at the tip of its abdomen. In the southwestern US there are two different species in the same genus, <i>S. convallis</i> and <i>S. grandis,</i> whose appearance and biology is very similar, though they apparently prey on different types of cicadas, such as <i>Diceroprocta.</i><br /> Links:<br /> <a href="http://www.whatsthatbug.com/killerwasps.html" target="_blank">Sphecius speciosus color photos</a><br /> <a href="http://www.insects.ucr.edu/ebeling/ebel9-2.html#mud daubers" target="_blank">General notes on various wasps and bees, photos</a><br /> <a href="http://muextension.missouri.edu/xplor/agguides/pests/g07391.htm" target="_blank">General notes on various wasps and bees, drawings</a></font> <p>&nbsp;</p></td>

They are fairly aggressive, and if the nests are disturbed you can expect to be stung, but fortunately the colonies have many fewer workers (less than 500) than colonies of yellowjackets (often in the thousands), so one does not generally get stung as many times. Nests are generally built in somewhat concealed locations, in tree hollows or structural cavities, and are therefore not as easy to blunder into accidentally as YJ nests, but harder to remove when found. They are predators on various sorts of insects, and one of the few wasps that can be found flying at night.</font>

Unlike hornets and yellowjackets, paper wasps have exposed, single nest combs in which all of the brood are raised. Nests are commonly built under eaves, and the wasps rarely re-use the same nest between years. Like most paper wasps they are only marginally aggressive, and one has to get rather close to a nest in order to provoke an attack. There are very few wasps per colony, in most areas of the country, rarely exceeding 50 adults at any given time.

Evidence for true mimicry is that the moths vary in color pattern geographically to precisely match the local bumblebee species. They hover at flowers while taking nectar, however, while bumblebees have to land to feed.

     <h3>Welcome to Pre-Business at the University of California, Riverside! </h3> 
     <p><img src="images/business_stud.jpg" alt="Pre-Business" width="228" height="179" border="1" align="right" class="photoborder" />Pre-Business is a two-year program to prepare students to apply to Business Administration. (The Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration is only offered at UC Riverside, UC Irvine, and UC Berkeley.) Students who enter UCR as freshmen initially enroll and are advised in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences in a Pre-Business status. The College breadth requirements and the prerequisites for Business Administration major are completed during the freshman and sophomore years. An application to Business Administration is submitted at the end of the sophomore year. Upon acceptance, students become Business Administration majors and are then advised in the Business Administration Department in the School of Business Administration. </p> 
     <p> Pre-Business students must attend a Business Administration Workshop in order to submit the Business Administration Application electronically the quarter in which the College breadth and lower division Business Administration prerequisites are being completed. Students must apply to Business Administration by the time <u>90</u> units are completed. Any exceptions <u>must</u> have the prior approval of the Assistant Dean in the School of Business Adminstration. </p> 
     <p><strong>Effective FALL 2012, a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.7 is required <u>with</u> a minimum 2.5 GPA in the combined GPA of the General Business Prerequisites <u>and</u> lower division Business requirements.&nbsp; This GPA requirement affects freshmen entering FALL 2012 and after.</strong></p> 
     <p>This web site provides you with the Pre-Business Worksheets that is used to record your progress in completing the breadth and business prerequisites. The web site will also answer general questions you may have regarding: academic options available to Pre-Business majors; eligibility requirements; application procedures for the Business Administration major; and much more. Please keep this information as a reference guide and review it often. Remember, it is your responsibility as a Pre-Business major to keep informed and up-to-date on the university, college, and major requirements necessary for you to major change to Business Administration and complete your degree. </p> 
     <p>Pre-Business students are advised in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, Student Academic Affairs Office. The office is located at 3400 Humanities and Social Sciences Building, and the phone number is (951) 827-3683. This will be your department until you are accepted to Business Administration. </p> 
     <p>Welcome again, we look forward to working with you. </p> 
     <p><em>Anthony Gonzalez</em><br /> <em>Pre-Business Advisor/Pre-Business Program Manager<br /> Pre-Business / College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</em></p>
