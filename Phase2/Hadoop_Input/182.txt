     <p><strong>Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox</strong></p> 
     <p>Kim A. Wilcox was appointed as the ninth chancellor of the University of California, Riverside by the UC Board of Regents on August 8, 2013.</p> 
     <p>Selected by UC President Mark G. Yudof after a nationwide search, Chancellor Wilcox succeeds Chancellor Timothy White, who left the post in late 2012 to become president of the California State University system. Jane Close Conoley, dean of the Gevirtz Graduate School of Education at UC Santa Barbara, served as UC Riverside interim chancellor for the seven months prior to his appointment.</p> 
     <p>A first-generation college graduate, Wilcox becomes chancellor during an exciting time on the UCR campus, with the opening of its new medical school, the announcement of a new school of public policy, expanding research opportunities and the potential to broaden the campus’s international reach.</p> 
     <p>As provost of Michigan State from 2005 to July 2013, Wilcox had oversight responsibilities for more than 200 academic programs, nearly 49,000 students and almost 5,000 faculty and academic staff. During that time, he implemented major institutional restructuring and strategic positioning initiatives, and helped lead a capital campaign that raised $1.4 billion. He added 100 new faculty positions, expanded the university’s two medical colleges and created the Residential College in the Arts and Humanities and the College of Music. Previously, he was dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Kansas, from 2002 to 2005, and president and chief executive officer of the Kansas Board of Regents from 1999 to 2002.</p>

Examples include the Philippine Rondalla Ensemble, Japanese Taiko Ensemble, Mariachi Ensemble, Mexican Folklorico Dance Group, and Andean Music Ensemble (Mayupatapi). We offer courses on the music of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Music Department includes a diverse student body, including Latino/a, African American, and Asian American students. <br /> <br />Among our graduate degrees is the study of Ethnomusicology. Ethnomusicology is a core strength of the UCR Music Department and features a theoretical orientation emphasizing new approaches to ethnographic research with a focus on cultural theory/cultural studies. Faculty members' specialties include area-studies emphases in Southeast Asia, Asian America, and Latin America. Combined with more than a dozen affiliated faculty in other departments, five world-music performance ensembles, and a new undergraduate major in Music and Culture, this makes the ethnomusicology program at UCR a leader in several areas of research and performance. <br /> <br /> The ethnomusicology program is committed to training a new generation of music scholars to bring the insights of cutting-edge cultural theory to original research based on solidly grounded, finely detailed ethnographic fieldwork. Beyond area-studies strengths in Latin America and Asia, our ethnomusicology faculty are known for their engagement with theoretical concerns at the forefront of contemporary research in their field, including music's relationship with popular culture, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, technology, politics, memory, and globalization. Though our program appeals particularly to graduate students who have wide-ranging curiosity about music and cultural meaning, drawing on fields ranging from anthropology to cultural studies and literary criticism, we also prepare students for the kinds of far-ranging interdisciplinary conversations that are a hallmark of the field of ethnomusicology today. <br /> <br /> Please see our website for more on all of our programs. <br /> <br /> <b> <u>Contact person(s)</u></b> <br /> Walter Clark, Dept.

Our curriculum is committed to the scholarly understanding of difference and diversity through interdisciplinary courses that lead to an undergraduate major and minor, as well as a future graduate program in &quot;Genders and Sexualities.&quot; The kind of knowledge production upon which Women's Studies relies can only be generated through appreciating and understanding the range of social positions and intersections of hierarchies that provide for varied experiences and interpretations of those experiences. The interdisciplinary mission of Women's Studies facilitates and promotes institutional alliances and relationships with traditional disciplines such as anthropology, economics, history, literary studies, sociology, history, philosophy, and political science, as well as the life sciences. Our methodological interrogations aim to engage and reshape the traditional separation between the humanities, the social sciences, and the sciences. We encourage the critical, creative, and contested debates within the field that continue to have a significant impact on the academy and the institutional identity of Women's Studies. <br /> <br /> <b> <u> Contact person(s)</u></b> <br /> Renee DeGuire <br /> 951-827-6427 <br /> <a href="mailto: renee.deguire@ucr.edu">renee.deguire@ucr.edu</a> </p>

Five key components, or commitments, were identified as important to the overall success of student-athletes: <br /> <br /> ? Academic Excellence <br /> ? Athletic Excellence <br />? Personal Development <br />? Career Development <br /> ? Community Service <br /> <br /> Commitment to these five areas reinforces the concept that student-athletes are students first and athletes second, but also that there are many other important aspects to the development of and preparation for a successful future. Support materials are continually being developed, discovered and disseminated, in order to provide participating campuses with a &quot;toolbox&quot; of resources to help them build and implement a program to meet their specific needs. While the program was initially developed for student-athletes, the NCAA encourages campuses to utilize the program and its resources to benefit the entire student population and campus community. CHAMPS participation includes a mandatory speaker series for our student athletes covering topics such as diversity, alternate lifestyles, as well as social issues involving HIV/AIDS, diet, drug and alcohol abuse. <br /> <br /> UCR officially began its involvement with the program in 2000, and there are currently more than 500 institutions and conference offices participating in the CHAMPS/Life Skills program nationwide. With the active involvement and support of many people in the campus community, we have built a solid foundation for our program through many successful initiatives and programs, and look forward to the continued growth and development of this important program. <br /> <br /> The UCR CHAMPS/Life Skills program includes a mandatory speaker series for our student-athletes covering topics such as diversity (including sexual orientation and gender identity), as well as social issues involving substance abuse, sexual responsibility, nutrition and gambling. <br /> <br /> Campus efforts include: <br /> <br /> ? Speakers presenting to department staff meetings on the topics of: sexual harassment, and diversity (including sexual orientation and gender identity) <br /> ? Athletics department receiving an NCAA award on gender equity compliance for 2008 <br /> ?

        <li>Students initiate their research with intense training during the summer.</li> 
        <li>Students are provided research assistantships throughout the academic year on a part-time basis. Students will present the results of their research at an annual UCR symposium and the annual Southern California Conference on Undergraduate Research, where they will meet student peers and recruiters from graduate schools.</li>
       </ol> 
       <br /> One of the unique features of the

       <p> <b> <u>College of Humanities, Arts &amp; Social Sciences - <br />Comparative Literature &amp; Foreign Language Department</u></b> <br /> <br /> <b> <u>Brief Description </u></b> <br /> Graduate Studies in Comparative Literature &amp; Foreign Language Program Summary The Department of Comparative Literature and Foreign Languages grants graduate degrees based on the comparative studies of world literatures and cultures. The Ph.D. degree has three tracks: </p>
       <ol> 
        <li>Interliterary Studies</li> 
        <li>Interdisciplinary Studies</li> 
        <li>Science Fiction, Science, and Literature</li>
       </ol> The department faculty, well balanced between Asianist and Europeanists, share a strong commitment to the study of literature through comparative and interdisciplinary approaches. We have particular strengths in comparative Asian and European studies; comparative ancient studies; gender and feminist studies; global cultures and post colonialism; film and visual culture studies; narrative and cultural translation; and science and science fiction. 
       <br /> 
       <br /> 
       <u> <b>Program Description</b></u> 
       <br /> 
       <br /> 
       <b>Master's Degree</b> 
       <br /> The Department of Comparative Literature and Foreign Languages requires the following for the M.A. degree in Comparative Literature. Candidates must work in three of the following literatures, or two literatures for students in the interdisciplinary track: Chinese, English (either British or American), French, German, Classical Greek, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Latin, Pilipino, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese. 
       <p> <b> Doctoral Degree</b> <br /> The Department of Comparative Literature and Foreign Languages offers the Ph.D. degree in Comparative Literature with two tracks: Interliterary Studies and Interdisciplinary Studies. Areas of particular strength in the Interdisciplinary Studies are comparative Asian and European studies; comparative ancient civilizations; gender and feminist studies; global cultures and post-colonialism; film and visual culture studies; narrative and cultural translation; and science and science fiction. </p> 
       <p> <b>Interliterary Studies</b> <br /> This program is designed for students wishing to concentrate in Comparative Literature as an interliterary discipline. Students examine the relation among various national literatures. They are expected to work in three of the following literatures: Chinese, English (either British or American), French, German, Classical Greek, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese. Permission is granted in exceptional cases to work in other literatures related to the Germanic, Romance, or Slavic families, in Hebrew or Arabic literature, in other Asian literatures, and the literatures of Africa. Students must obtain comprehensive knowledge of their first literature (the major specialty), in its language, literary history, and critical scholarship. In their two other literatures, they specialize in a genre, a period, critical school or theoretical approach, always in combination with their main literature. Work in the three literatures must be done in the languages of these literatures. </p> 
       <p> <b>Interdisciplinary Studies </b> <br />This program is designed for students with interests in interdisciplinary studies. Students examine relation between literary studies and other disciplines (such as art, ethnic studies, film, history, law, music, philosophy, political science, psychology, religious studies, science, sociology, theater). Students complete the literary requirements of the program but substitute an appropriate discipline for one of the second or third literatures. This option is recommended to students who enter Comparative Literature with an M.A. in a non-literary discipline. </p> 
       <p> <b>Science Fiction, Science, and Literature:</b> <br /> This option is designed for students with interests in science fiction studies and the relations of science to world literature. It builds upon the current widespread interest in Science Fiction and draws on the Eaton Collection. The program is intended for students who have already completed an undergraduate degree in Comparative Literature, English or kindred studies. It draws on the speculative richness of science fiction literature in a wide variety of social contexts, including the role of science in society (genetic engineering, artificial environments, nanotechnology, etc.), race and ethnicity, and social ethics. This track interacts with existing programs in the humanities, arts, social sciences and sciences. It is inherently cross-disciplinary both within the humanities, and between the humanities and sciences. </p>

It also has programs in Comparative Literature (including World Literature), in Comparative Ancient Civilizations, and in Linguistics. Its programs encourage a wide variety of both disciplinary and interdisciplinary interests. The department believes in the importance of offering fundamental training in the humanities in their own literary and linguistic contexts as well as in their cultural and interdisciplinary dimensions. Accordingly, students may obtain degrees or take courses in a specialized field, while at the same time enhancing the breadth of their education within and outside of the department. <br /> <br /> Some subject areas, such as Asian Literatures and Cultures (including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Indonesian), Classical Studies (Ancient Greek and Classical Latin), French, Germanic Studies, and Russian Studies, offer both a major and a minor. Others do not currently have a major, but a minor is available, as in Italian Studies. <br /> <br /> <b>Majors</b> <br />The department offers the following majors leading to the B.A. degree. </p>

       <p> <b> <u>College of Humanities, Arts &amp; Social Sciences - <br /> Religious Studies - Graduate <br /> <br /> Brief Description</u></b> <br /> Courses and curriculum in religious studies. <br /> <br /> <b> <u> Program Summary</u></b> <br /> The mission of the Religious Studies Department is to foster research and teaching about the diverse religious communities and traditions of the world (and the diverse debates they generate) and to service the local and global communities through this work. Diversity is integral to and correlative with the research, teaching, and service mission of the Religious Studies Department's faculty, staff, and students. Diversity is a feature of our field. <br /> <br /> The Department of Religious Studies at UCR offers a small, focused graduate program designed to train advanced students in the critical study of religious traditions. The program engages religion as a political and social dynamic on the international stage, critically appraising the force of religions in contemporary global cultures, contacts, and conflicts. Students coming to work in our graduate program are therefore expressing an interest in delving into particular ways of studying religions: through the political, cultural, ideological, and interpretive lenses by which people understand themselves and others. This view of religious discourses not only describes the academic approach of our faculty, but also provides critical interfaces with scholarly work conducted through the University, and in diverse areas of humanistic studies. <br /> <br />Our program offers not only the expertise of our faculty, but also rich interdisciplinary connections at UCR and across the University of California system. <br /> <br /> The program offers two degree tracks: </p>
       <ul> 
        <li>A terminal M.A. program allows students to explore the academic study of religions more broadly and is geared toward students who wish to expand their study of religions in an academic environment but may not yet wish to pursue a career in academia. </li> 
        <li>A more specialized Ph.D. program prepares students to enter into academia as researchers and university instructors in a specific field of expertise.</li>
       </ul> All students are oriented to the methodological and theoretical focus of the program through three core courses taken in their first year. The specific focus of these classes varies from year to year depending on the faculty member leading the seminar, but consistently provides students not only with a firm grounding in the &quot;methods and theories&quot; of the study of religions, but practical experience in exploring contemporary issues of religions in the public square. 
       <br /> 
       <br /> In addition to these methodological core courses, the Graduate Program offers advanced seminars in diverse areas along two geographic axes : Religions in the West and Asian Religions. These two broad geographic areas encompass traditional fields of research and teaching in the academic study of religions, maximizing the resources available to our students within the Department, the College, and the University as a whole. Not only will students benefit from the expertise of the faculty of the Department of Religious Studies, they will also capitalize on the rich resources of the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences: the Asian Studies program, the Native American Studies program, Comparative Literature (including German, French, Chinese, and Japanese literatures and cultures), and the developing program in Southeast Asian Studies, among others.

Diversity is integral to and correlative with the research, teaching, and service mission of the Religious Studies Department's faculty, staff, and students. Diversity is a feature of our field. <br /> <br /> Given the numerous cultures and ethnicities, worldviews, ritual practices, honored texts, and revered figures that mark religious communities across the globe, and given the pluralistic feature of our southern California region and our world more broadly, the importance of understanding differing community histories and differing ways of seeing, valuing, being, and doing cannot be overstated. This is what we study and teach in Religious Studies, together with critical perspectives and the debates they generate. <br /> <br /> Our strategies for fostering and sustaining this work and these goals include the development of empathy with others who are unfamiliar to and different from the self, together with critical (and self-critical) thinking vis-&agrave;-vis written and oral traditions, textual studies and in-person exchange. To these ends, faculty employ a diversity of questions and therefore methods they bring to their work. These include historical and philosophical, textual and ethnographic, cultural and ethical concerns and approaches. <br /> <br /> We value our intellectually, culturally, and ethnically diverse faculty and staff as well as student population. We seek to develop a welcoming atmosphere of inclusiveness through an active and ongoing engagement with diversity in many ways: in searches for new appointments both temporary and permanent, in graduate student recruitment, in the curricular course offerings, in faculty and student research projects, and in communities of inquiry whom, and with whom, we study. Interested faculty and graduate students spend time, for example, in India, Indonesia, Mexico, Taiwan, and Thailand for research, and have been invited to Turkey, Poland, Denmark, England, Finland, and Iran, for scholarly exchange. <br /> <br /> <b> <u> Contact person(s)</u></b> <br /> June O'Connor, Prof./Dept.

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> 
    <p>Last modified: December 20, 2013 (<a href="../../policies/privacy/archive/">view archived versions</a>) </p>
    <p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-account">Google Account</a>, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. </p>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy explains: </p>
    <ul> 
     <li>What information we collect and why we collect it. </li>
     <li>How we use that information. </li>
     <li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/">key terms</a> first. Your privacy matters to Google so whether you are new to Google or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions <a href="http://support.google.com/policies/troubleshooter/2990837?hl=en&amp;rd=2">consult this page</a>. </p>
    <h2 id="infocollect">Information we collect</h2> 
    <p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or the people who matter most to you online. </p>
    <p>We collect information in two ways: </p>
    <ul> 
     <li> <p><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account. When you do, we’ll ask for <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-personal-info">personal information</a>, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112783">Google Profile</a>, which may include your name and photo. </p></li>
     <li> <p><strong>Information we get from your use of our services.</strong> We may collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes: </p>
      <ul> 
       <li> <p><strong>Device information</strong> </p><p>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-unique-device-id">unique device identifiers</a>, and mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account. </p></li>
       <li> <p><strong>Log information</strong> </p><p>When you use our services or view content provided by Google, we may automatically collect and store certain information in <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-server-logs">server logs</a>. This may include: </p>
        <ul> 
         <li>details of how you used our service, such as your search queries. </li>
         <li>telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls. </li>
         <li><a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-ip">Internet protocol address</a>. </li>
         <li>device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. </li>
         <li>cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Google Account.</li>
        </ul> </li>
       <li> <p><strong>Location information</strong> </p><p>When you use a location-enabled Google service, we may collect and process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. </p></li>
       <li> <p><strong>Unique application numbers</strong> </p><p>Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. </p></li>
       <li> <p><strong>Local storage</strong> </p><p>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML&nbsp;5) and application data caches. </p></li>
       <li> <p><strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</strong> </p><p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Google service, and this may include sending one or more <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-cookie">cookies</a> or <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-identifier">anonymous identifiers</a> to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Google features that may appear on other sites.</p></li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul> 
    <h2 id="infouse">How we use information we collect</h2> 
    <p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads. </p>
    <p>We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Profile information, such as your name and photo. </p>
    <p>When you contact Google, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements. </p>
    <p>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-pixel">pixel tags</a>, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health. </p>
    <p>We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent. </p>
    <p>We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>Google processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live. </p>
    <h2 id="infochoices">Transparency and choice</h2> 
    <p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can: </p>
    <ul> 
     <li><a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/?hl=en">Review and control</a> certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard. </li>
     <li><a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/preferences?hl=en">View and edit</a> your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here. </li>
     <li><a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112783">Use our editor</a> to see and adjust how your Google Profile appears to particular individuals. </li>
     <li><a href="http://support.google.com/plus/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;guide=1257347">Control</a> who you share information with. </li>
     <li><a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">Take information</a> out of many of our services.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences. </p>
    <h2 id="infosharing">Information you share</h2> 
    <p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content. </p>
    <h2 id="access">Accessing and updating your personal information</h2> 
    <p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. </p>
    <p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems). </p>
    <p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. </p>
    <h2 id="nosharing">Information we share</h2> 
    <p>We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies: </p>
    <ul> 
     <li> <p><strong>With your consent</strong> </p><p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-info">sensitive personal information</a>. </p></li>
     <li> <p><strong>With domain administrators</strong> </p><p>If your Google Account is managed for you by a <a href="http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=178897">domain administrator</a> (for example, for Google Apps users) then your domain administrator and resellers who provide user support to your organization will have access to your Google Account information (including your email and other data). Your domain administrator may be able to: </p>
      <ul> 
       <li>view statistics regarding your account, like statistics regarding applications you install. </li>
       <li>change your account password. </li>
       <li>suspend or terminate your account access. </li>
       <li>access or retain information stored as part of your account. </li>
       <li>receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. </li>
       <li>restrict your ability to delete or edit information or privacy settings.</li>
      </ul> <p>Please refer to your domain administrator’s privacy policy for more information. </p></li>
     <li> <p><strong>For external processing</strong> </p><p>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. </p></li>
     <li> <p><strong>For legal reasons</strong> </p><p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: </p>
      <ul> 
       <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. </li>
       <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations. </li>
       <li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. </li>
       <li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul> 
    <p>We may share aggregated, <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-info">non-personally identifiable information</a> publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. </p>
    <p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </p>
    <h2 id="infosecurity">Information security</h2> 
    <p>We work hard to protect Google and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular: </p>
    <ul> 
     <li>We encrypt many of our services <a href="http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?answer=173733&amp;en">using SSL</a>. </li>
     <li>We offer you <a href="//www.google.com/intl/en/landing/2step/">two step verification</a> when you access your Google Account, and a <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/security.html">Safe Browsing feature</a> in Google Chrome. </li>
     <li>We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems. </li>
     <li>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h2 id="application">Application</h2> 
    <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including services offered on other sites (such as our advertising services), but excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <p>Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you in search results, sites that may include Google services, or other sites linked from our services. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise our services, and who may use cookies, pixel tags and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads. </p>
    <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2> 
    <p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several <a href="../../policies/privacy/frameworks/">self regulatory frameworks</a>. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly. </p>
    <h2 id="policychanges">Changes</h2> 
    <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. </p>
    <h2 id="products">Specific product practices</h2> 
    <p>The following notices explain specific privacy practices with respect to certain Google products and services that you may use: </p>
    <ul> 
     <li><a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html">Chrome and Chrome OS</a> </li>

      <h3>Master of Finance Program</h3> 
      <p>Globalization, rapid advances in computational technology, unprecedented financial innovation and shifting regulatory regimes have all contributed to additional job opportunities for finance professionals with education beyond a bachelor's degree.</p> 
      <p>The new <strong>Master of Finance (MFin)</strong> program at the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management addresses this substantial unmet demand for trained finance professionals.</p> 
      <p>By providing a comprehensive overview of the entire field of finance, with an emphasis on empirical methods and applications, the three-quarter (48 quarter units) MFin program will enable finance executives to gain the specialized expertise required for professional advancement, and prepare students who seek to pursue professional certifications in finance including all levels of the CFA and GRP.</p> 
      <h4>Some possible career paths for MFin students:</h4> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Investment management</li> 
       <li>Investment banking</li> 
       <li>Corporate finance</li> 
       <li>Private wealth management</li> 
       <li>Risk management</li> 
       <li>Asset Management</li> 
       <li>Quantitative Research</li> 
       <li>Equities Trading</li>
